# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This documentation outlines a Movie Recommendation System implemented in Python. The system employs a collaborative filtering approach, calculating similarity scores between users based on their movie preferences. The recommendations are generated by identifying movies liked by similar users and suggesting them to the target user.

## Problem Description
The primary goal of this Movie Recommendation System is to offer personalized movie recommendations based on the movie ratings provided by users. The system utilizes the Euclidean distance metric to measure similarity between users. It takes into account a dataset of user movie ratings, where each user's ratings for various movies are stored.

## Input Variables
- `user_ratings_dataset`: A dictionary representing user movie ratings, where the keys are user full names and the values are dictionaries containing movie ratings.

## Usage
To get movie recommendations, execute the script using the command: `python main.py` and type the name and surname of the user for which you want to get recommendations.
